# Programming Exercises

The exercises come from different instances of the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). The statement of each problem can be found on [ICPC Live Archive](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/) (e.g. type '4493 that is your queue' on Google and take the first link).
